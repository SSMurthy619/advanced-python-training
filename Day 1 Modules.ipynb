    "# Why Context Managers Exist\n",
    "# Many operations in Python require setup and cleanup logic:\n",
    "# - Opening and closing files\n",
    "# - Acquiring and releasing locks\n",
    "# - Opening and closing database connections\n",
    "# - Measuring execution time\n",
    "# - Temporarily changing application state\n",
    "# If cleanup is forgotten or skipped due to an exception, resources leak and bugs appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Context managers provide a reliable, structured way to ensure cleanup always happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Consider manual resource handling:\n",
    "# file = open(\"data.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "# data = file.read()\n",
    "# file.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using try/finally improves safety but increases boilerplate and repetition.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The with Statement\n",
    "# The with statement solves this problem by guaranteeing cleanup.\n",
    "# with open(\"data.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "#     data = file.read()\n",

    "# Execution flow:\n",

    "* Retry count\n",
    "* Permission role\n",
    "* Timeout duration\n",

    "## Structure of a Parameterized Decorator\n",
    "\n",
    "A parameterized decorator has **three levels**:\n",

    "1. Configuration function (receives decorator arguments)\n",
    "2. Decorator function (receives the function)\n",
    "3. Wrapper function (wraps execution)\n",

    "## Simple Parameterized Decorator Example\n",
